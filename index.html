      <p>Knowing the basics and syntax of one programming language. Most students tend to know Java, C, or Python from their colleges/highschools. You can stick to the one you are comfortable with from these three, but if C is your preferred language, I would recommend you to switch to C++. My first language was C, which made me switch to C++. I learned Java on the side, enjoyed it more, and decided to practice competitive coding in Java, and so every interview I have ever cracked was by using Java. I had zero experience in python, but after joining Facebook, all of the code I have written as an intern is in Python.</p>

    <p class="delay">One million memories, ten thousand inside jokes, one hundred shared secrets, one reason: best friends. I hope that as we grow older we all make even more memories, jokes, and shared secrets. We can already imagine us becoming old buddies who take our morning walks together as we gossip about what’s going on in our lives. Your friendship is for keeps, and We intend to keep it forever.</p>
